## Refactored Main Screen

### `user_details_screen.dart`
- Dramatically simplified from ~270 lines to ~25 lines
- Now uses only the modular widgets
- Clean and maintainable structure
- Easy to understand and modify

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Modularity**
- Each component is now a separate, reusable widget
- Easy to test individual components
- Components can be reused in other parts of the app

### 2. **Maintainability**
- Code is organized logically
- Easy to find and modify specific functionality
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. **Reusability**
- Widgets can be used in other screens
- Consistent UI components across the app
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle followed

### 4. **Readability**
- Main screen file is much cleaner and easier to understand
- Each widget has a single responsibility
- Code is self-documenting through meaningful names

### 5. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new sections or modify existing ones
- New features can be added without touching the main screen
- Better team collaboration with smaller, focused files

## Usage Example

```dart
import '../widgets/user_details/index.dart';

// The refactored screen is now much simpler:
class UserDetailScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final User user;

  const UserDetailScreen({Key? key, required this.user}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: Colors.grey[50],
      appBar: const UserDetailsAppBar(),
      body: SingleChildScrollView(
        child: Column(
          children: [
            UserHeaderCard(user: user),
            UserContentSections(user: user),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The refactoring is complete and all files are properly structured for professional Flutter development!
